Use this package if you need more customization when notifying your user. For Android developers, it is made to substitute
toasts and snackbars. IOS developers, I don't know what you use there, but you will like it.

See the [install instructions](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flushbar#-installing-tab-).
